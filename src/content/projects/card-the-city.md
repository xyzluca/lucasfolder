Card the City is my current project that I'm actively working on. It represents a new approach to exploring and interacting with urban environments through digital interfaces.

## Project Status

This project is currently in active development. I'm exploring innovative ways to represent city data and urban experiences through interactive design patterns.

## What I'm Building

While I'm keeping specific details under wraps for now, the project involves:
- **Interactive city exploration** through card-based interfaces
- **Modern web technologies** for optimal user experience
- **Data visualization** of urban patterns and information
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop use

## Development Approach

I'm taking a methodical approach to this project, focusing on:
- User experience research and testing
- Clean, maintainable code architecture
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility considerations

More details and a live demo will be available soon as the project progresses toward its initial release.
