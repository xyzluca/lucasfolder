This was my previous personal website and digital garden that served as a central hub for my thoughts, projects, and professional journey. Built with modern web technologies focusing on performance, accessibility, and clean design.

**Note**: This is my old website. You are currently viewing my new and improved site built with Astro, which offers better performance and a more refined experience.

## Features

- **Clean, minimal design** focused on content and readability
- **Fast performance** with Next.js 14 and static generation
- **TypeScript** for better developer experience and type safety
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **SEO optimized** for better discoverability

## Technical Details

The site uses Next.js 14 with the app router for optimal performance and developer experience. All content is written in Markdown and statically generated at build time. The design emphasizes typography and whitespace for excellent readability.

This project represents my approach to web development: focusing on fundamentals, performance, and user experience over flashy features.
