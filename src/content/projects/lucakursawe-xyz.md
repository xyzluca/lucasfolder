My personal website and digital garden that serves as a central hub for my thoughts, projects, and professional journey. Built with modern web technologies focusing on performance, accessibility, and clean design.

## Features

- **Clean, minimal design** focused on content and readability
- **Fast performance** with Next.js 14 and static generation
- **TypeScript** for better developer experience and type safety
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **SEO optimized** for better discoverability

## Technical Details

The site uses Next.js 14 with the app router for optimal performance and developer experience. All content is written in Markdown and statically generated at build time. The design emphasizes typography and whitespace for excellent readability.

This project represents my approach to web development: focusing on fundamentals, performance, and user experience over flashy features.
