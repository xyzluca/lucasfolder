REP.js is a comprehensive web application designed for serious strength training enthusiasts who want to optimize their workouts through data-driven approaches and auto-regulation techniques.

## Core Features

### E1RM Calculator
Advanced one-rep maximum estimation using multiple proven formulas (Brzycki, Epley, etc.) to help users understand their true strength levels across different lifts.

### Progress Tracking
Detailed workout logging system that tracks sets, reps, weights, and RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) with comprehensive historical data analysis.

### Data Visualization
Interactive charts powered by Chart.js displaying:
- Strength progression over time
- Volume trends and periodization
- Lift-specific performance analysis
- Training frequency patterns

### Auto-Regulation Tools
Smart recommendations for training loads based on:
- Previous session performance
- Recovery indicators
- Planned periodization
- Individual strength curves

## Technical Stack

Built with vanilla JavaScript for maximum performance and Chart.js for responsive data visualizations. Supabase handles backend operations including user authentication, secure data storage, and real-time synchronization across devices.

## Philosophy

This project embodies my belief that strength training, like programming, benefits from systematic approaches, data analysis, and continuous optimization. It combines my passion for fitness with technical skills to create practical tools for the strength community.
